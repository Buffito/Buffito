Almost a full-stack-ish developer that mostly chills on the backend, where the logic lives and the UI doesn’t yell at me.  
Been working professionally for 3+ years writing C# (.NET), fighting SQL joins (hi FirebirdSQL 👹), and trying to center a `<div>` without summoning dark forces.

## 🎯 Main Quest
- Gather as much EXP as I can to level up (and maybe respec into Senior Dev someday)

## 🧩 Sidequests
- Refactoring old repos because I enjoy pain and version control nightmares
- Experimenting with new stacks when not painting Warhammer minis like a true templar
- Avoiding burnout by calling it “learning through hobby projects”

## 🛠️ Stack Rotation
`.NET` `.NET Core` `Flask` `Node.js` `PostgreSQL` `MySQL` `FirebirdSQL` `Google Firebase` `Kotlin`

> 💬 Also fluent in: Googling error messages, muttering "this should work", and consuming copious amount of caffeine.
