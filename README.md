## 👋 Hi there, my name is Theodoros

Almost a full-stack-ish developer that mostly chills on the backend, where the logic lives and the UI doesn’t yell at me.  
Been working professionally for 3+ years writing mostly C# (.NET), fighting SQL joins (hi FirebirdSQL 👹), and trying to center a `<div>` without summoning dark forces.

## 🎯 Main Quest
- Gather as much EXP as I can to level up (and maybe respec into Senior Dev someday)

## 🧩 Sidequests
- Refactoring old repos because I enjoy pain and version control nightmares
- Experimenting with new stacks when not painting Warhammer minis
- Avoiding burnout by calling it “learning through hobby projects”

## 🧰 Tech Arsenal
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,dotnet,flask,kotlin,nodejs,py,postgres,postman,mongodb,mysql)](https://skillicons.dev)

> 💬 Also fluent in: Googling error messages, muttering "this should work" and consuming copious amount of caffeine.
